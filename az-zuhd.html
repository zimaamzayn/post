            <h1>Az-Zuhd: Renouncing Worldly Pleasures for Nearness to Allah</h1>
            <p class="author-info">By Zimaam Zayn</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Assalamu Alykum! I have always been eager to learn about renouncing worldly pleasures in a balanced way—staying within the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, without falling into extremes. So, I read Az-Zuhd by Imam Ibn Qayyim (رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ) and wrote this summary for you all to benefit from.</p>
<h2>The Purpose of Prophethood</h2>
<p>To Understand Zuhd we need to Understand the life of "Best Zahid" - Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his aims as a Messenger.</p>
<p>Allah states in the Qur’an:</p>

<i>"He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them and teaching them the Book and the Wisdom. And verily, they had been before in manifest error." (Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 2)</i>

<p>Shaykh Naasir As-Sa’di explains in his Tafsir that the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was sent to humanity to guide them towards purification by instilling noble characteristics and deterring them from vile and degrading vices.</p>

<h2>Zuhd and Purification of the Soul</h2>

<p><strong>Zuhd</strong> (renunciation of worldly pleasures) is among the greatest means of purifying the soul. It entails refraining from worldly desires in pursuit of something greater in the Hereafter. Recognizing the fleeting and insignificant nature of this world aids in cultivating Zuhd.</p>

<p>Ibn Al-Mubarak, when addressed as a Zaahid, humbly responded:</p>

<i>"The true Zaahid is Umar ibn Abdul Azeez, who turned away from immense wealth and luxury that was at his disposal. As for me, I have very little to give up."</i>

<p>(Umar ibn Abdul Azeez was a Tabi’i from Madinah and the great-grandson of Umar ibn Al-Khattab.)</p>

<h2>The Worldly Life vs. The Hereafter</h2>

<p>The self is naturally preoccupied with this world, requiring conscious effort to detach from it. The Prophet ﷺ stated:</p>

<i>"Whoever is preoccupied with this life, Allah will make poverty apparent in his eyes. But whoever focuses on the Hereafter, Allah will place wealth within his heart."</i>

<h2>The Deception of This World</h2>

<p>Allah warns in the Qur’an about it:</p>

<i>“Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. It is like vegetation after rain, pleasing to the tiller, then it dries up, turns yellow, and becomes straw. But in the Hereafter, there is severe torment (for the disbelievers) and forgiveness and good pleasure from Allah (for the believers). Whereas the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.” (Surah Al-Hadid: 20)</i>

<i>“Verily, the likeness of this worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, producing intermingled vegetation that men and cattle consume. When the earth is adorned and beautified, and its people think they have full control, Our Command reaches it by night or day, reducing it to clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday.” (Surah Yunus: 24)</i>

<h2>The Reality of True Wealth</h2>

<p>Wealth and children are just adornments of this life, while righteous deeds are far superior in Allah’s sight as he has stated:</p>

<i>“Say: ‘Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is far better for him who fears Allah.’” (Surah An-Nisa: 77)</i>
<br>
<i>“Nay, you prefer the life of this world, although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.” (Surah Al-A’la: 16-17)</i>

<h2>Defining Zuhd</h2>

<p>Ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>

<i>“Zuhd is to leave aside that which does not benefit you in the Hereafter, while Wara’a (piety) is to avoid what may harm you in the Hereafter.”</i>

<p>Sufyan Ath-Thawri described Zuhd as:</p>

<i>“Having minimal expectations and not necessarily wearing poor garments or eating inadequate food.”</i>

<p>Imam Ahmad categorized Zuhd into three levels:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Abstaining from Haram (forbidden) acts – applicable to all believers.</li>
    <li>Abstaining from unnecessary Halal acts – applicable to the righteous.</li>
    <li>Abstaining from anything that distracts from Allah – applicable to the knowledgeable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scholars state that six qualities define a true Zaahid:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Moderation in spending.</li>
    <li>Lack of desire for leadership.</li>
    <li>Simplicity in appearance.</li>
    <li>Avoiding excessive social interaction.</li>
    <li>Mastery over one’s desires.</li>
    <li>Prioritizing matters concerning Allah.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classification of Zuhd</h2>
<p>Zuhd has been divided into three catogeries they are as 3 level one starts from the first and then continues till the last. These levels are:</p>
<h3>Zuhd in Doubtful Matters</h3>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<i>“That which is lawful is clear, and that which is unlawful is clear. Between the two are doubtful matters that many people are unaware of. Whoever avoids these doubtful matters absolves himself of blame regarding his religion and honor. But whoever indulges in doubtful matters will eventually fall into that which is unlawful, just like a shepherd who grazes too close to restricted land.” (Bukhari 1/126)</i>

<p>The stages of Zuhd in doubtful matters are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Avoiding doubtful matters, which cannot be achieved without first abstaining from the unlawful.</li>
    <li>Disliking that Allah may reduce one’s status, fearing divine displeasure over human criticism.</li>
    <li>Avoiding wasteful engagement with sinful and corrupt people.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zuhd in Permissible Matters</h3>

<p>A believer cannot fully attain Zuhd unless he:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Moderates his spending.</li>
    <li>Utilizes his spare time in devotion.</li>
    <li>Frees himself from emotional distress.</li>
    <li>Adorns himself with the character of the Prophets and the righteous.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these things are permissible but a Zahid fears accounting in Hereafter and hence avoid or minimise them.</p>
<p>A true Zaahid does not abandon essential needs but ensures his actions bring him closer to Allah. His nourishment, relationships, rest, and sustenance are all dedicated to serving his Lord, provided his intention aligns with seeking Allah’s pleasure.</p>

<h3>Zuhd in Zuhd Itself</h3>

<p>To attain complete Zuhd, a person must:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Avoid disregarding Zuhd – he should never belittle his effort to abstain from worldly indulgences.</li>
    <li>Maintain moderation in giving and withholding – balance is key.</li>
    <li>Consider the world insignificant – the more one detaches from it, the higher Allah elevates him.</li>
    <li>Recognize that Allah alone is the Provider and Taker – whatever a person receives or loses is by divine decree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Zuhd does not mean deprivation but rather prioritization. Hasan Al-Basri stated:</p>

<i>“Zuhd is not making the permissible forbidden, nor wasting wealth. Rather, it is knowing that what is with Allah is better than what you possess.”</i>

<p>Scholars have debated the true nature of Zuhd. Some claim it applies only to permissible matters, while others argue it applies strictly to avoiding the unlawful. The best approach is balance: if permissible acts divert one from Allah, abstaining from them is preferred. If they bring one closer to Allah, engaging in them is more virtuous.</p>

<p>May Allah grant us understanding and enable us to live with Zuhd in a manner pleasing to Him. <strong>Ameen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stay-Safe. Allah-Hafiz!</strong></p>
