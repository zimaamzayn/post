<h2>Noori : Story of a Revert Sister</h2> 

<p class="author-info">By Zimaam Zayn</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
<p>Assalamu Alykum. I've been in contact with Muslim reverts but some of them have a beautiful story, during the writing of our next article on Love Before Marriage. I got an opportunity to meet a revert online. She is a sister and her story has a great & important moral. I hope this inspires us towards our belief. I've tried to keep it in her wording (just made it readable) and removed some unnecessary parts. As she hasn't told her family about her conversion, we'll call her by her Muslim name - Noori.</p> <p>She is Noori, a FMGE aspirant and here is what she then described to us:</p> <p>So (basically) I got into a relationship in 2018 when I was in Russia and the guy was Muslim. I was very religious being a Hindu and he did never interfere in my religious practices. </p><p>When I came back to India in June 2018 for vacation, I bought a prayer mat for my boyfriend to gift him. I just wanted him to pray Salah (and not miss it), but I don't know why ( did it came in my mind). So I got it from some online site and then gifted it to him.</p> <p>In 2019, we started living together in a two-room apartment, one room for him and one for me. I wanted him to fast for Ramadan like I wanted him to pray. We had a common friend who was like a brother to me (he was a Muslim too), so during Ramadan he stayed in our flat. I used to cook Iftar and Sehri for him. Also, I was feeling happy about these things.</p> <p>Cut to during Covid times 2020, I was watching a series and I got to know about Adam and Eve. I googled about them, of course, to know more about them as I found their story interesting. Then I learned about the Islamic version of Adam (A.S.) and Hadrat Hawwa's story.</p> <p>I also learned the story about Iblis (Satan), and I found it interesting but then I forgot about it for some time.</p> <p>Few months later, I saw a dream where I was running on barren land and fire shots were raining upon me. I screamed, "Allah! Allah!" and then I got rescued and taken away from that land. I woke up feeling scared, and that dream felt real to me.</p> <p>I shared this with my boyfriend, and he said I should study about it and think about it. I asked, "from where?" He showed me a daee (Islamic preacher). I saw that and thought, "what nonsense he speaks," and ignored him.</p> <p>Few days later, I saw another dream where I saw a few characters from the Islamic Caliphate and companions of the Prophet. I woke up and shared my dream with my boyfriend. He said they existed earlier, and he briefly told me about them. I was thinking—I've never heard about their names before, so how did I know there were such people existing before us?</p> <p>A few weeks passed, and I started believing in one God—God is one and formless—by studying more about the story of Nuh (A.S.), which matched with the Hindu story of Pralay and other things.</p> <p>When I had firmly believed that God is one, I thought, "When I get married to my boyfriend, I will revert to Islam." I called my sister (cousin) to talk after a very long time about this topic. I slowly shared my thoughts that God is one and all about Islam. She was like—"this is exactly what I wanted to talk about with you (Noorah)," and she said she believed the same. We were amazed how we were on the same path even though distant. Then she said she had already reverted to Islam. That was shocking for me!</p> <p>Then I thought—if my sister can revert and accept Islam, then I can too. I told my boyfriend that I want to revert. He thought I was just having a passing interest or infatuation, so he said, "study more about Islam and then tell me." I asked my Muslim friend how to do Ghusl, and since she didn't know, I called my boyfriend's sister who helped me with the steps. I performed Ghusl, and then I told my boyfriend that I want to revert to Islam. That day, my boyfriend's father (who is very religious) helped me take Shahada with its meanings, and I became a Muslim.</p> <p>Then he asked me how I felt now, and I said I felt nothing.</p> <p>On the same day, I wanted to pray Salah. I knew how Muslims pray by action, but I didn't know what to recite. So I googled how to pray Namaz, and I learned that women have minor differences in the way they pray— but I want to tell you, my dear revert sister, it's the same for Muslims whether male or female. My boyfriend helped me with what to recite and what not to during Salah. I learned the Surah Ikhlas and Surah Fatiha, and with that, I prayed my first Namaz—Alhamdulillah! I made a few mistakes, but by the second or third time, I was perfect at it. Then I learned everything about what to recite and when during Namaz. I began to pray five times a day.</p> <p>Soon, within ten days, Ramadan began. I told my boyfriend I wanted to fast, and initially, he didn't believe it. But then he helped me with the rulings and all the fasting rules for Ramadan.</p> <p>He is also a student, and if he passes his FMGE, he'll speak with his parents about us. After a few days, we broke up. We did Tauba for our sins, made a commitment to never repeat our pre-marriage relationship or talk about it again, and left it for the sake of Allah.</p> <p>My parents are doubtful about my changing behavior, as I was previously a dedicated Hindu and now openly reject idol worship and Pooja. When I am at home, I pray at night when everyone sleeps, like Isha and Fajr. I sometimes miss other prayers because some family members are always in the room.</p> <p>This is my short story of reverting to Islam. I am going to give FMGE again this time. InshaAllah, I will pass with a good score. <strong>Ameen.</p> <p>Allah Hafiz!</p> </strong><h3>Why I've chosen her story for this article?</h2> <p>The simple answer is that I loved the way she broke up with her partner when she identified that it was haram for them to be in a relationship. This correlates with our next article - Love Before Marriage.</p> <p><strong>Be Curious, Allah-Hafiz!</strong></p>
