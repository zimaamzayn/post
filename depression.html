<h2>Depression: Cause And It's Quranic Solution</h2>

<p class="author-info">By Zimaam Zayn</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
<h3>In the Name of Allah, the Most Kind, the Most Merciful</h3> <p>My dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about something very important that affects many people â€” feelings of sadness, worry, and depression. These are heavy feelings that can make life very difficult. But Alhamdulillah, Islam gives us clear answers and real solutions to these problems.</p> <p>First, let me say this is not a medical book. This is about healing our hearts and souls through faith. Did you know the word <em>"psychology"</em> actually comes from the Greek word for <em>"study of the soul"</em>? Today, people have forgotten this important truth. Modern psychology often looks only at the mind and forgets about the soul that Allah has placed within each of us.</p> <h3>Why Do People Feel So Sad and Worried?</h3> <p>There are five main reasons people fall into depression and anxiety:</p> <h4>1. Not Understanding Why We Exist</h4> <p>Many people wake up every day, go to work, eat, sleep â€” but don't know why they're really here. It's like being put on a train without knowing where it's going. Wouldn't that make you nervous?</p> <p>Some modern philosophers say life has no meaning. They tell people, <strong>"You're born, you suffer, you die â€” that's it."</strong> No wonder so many people feel hopeless by these books or by their own thoughts.</p> <h4>2. Fear of What Might Happen Tomorrow</h4> <p>A young man worries: <em>"Will I pass my exams? Will I find a good job? What if I fail?"</em></p> <p>A mother stays awake at night thinking: <em>"What if something bad happens to my children?"</em></p> <p>When we don't trust in Allah's plan, the future can seem very scary.</p> <h4>3. Seeing Others Succeed While We Struggle</h4> <p>Imagine working hard but never getting ahead, while your neighbors seem to have everything. Or being sick while others are healthy. It's easy to feel life is unfair.</p> <h4>4. Thinking Too Much About Death</h4> <p>Some people become so afraid of dying that they can't enjoy living. They forget that death is just a door to the next life.</p> <h4>5. Not Reaching Our Dreams</h4> <p>What happens when you study for years but can't get the job you want? Or when your business fails? Without faith, these disappointments can break our hearts.</p> <h3>The Quran â€” Allah's Perfect Cure</h3> <blockquote> <p>Allah tells us in the Quran:</p> <p><strong>"O mankind! There has come to you good advice from your Lord, and healing for what is in the hearts."</strong> <em>(Yunus 10:57)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Where does sadness live? In the heart. And Allah has sent us the perfect medicine for our hearts â€” His words.</p> <h3>Allah's Promises to Believers</h3> <ul> <li><strong>"Whoever does good, whether male or female, while believing â€” We will surely grant them a good life."</strong> <em>(An-Nahl 16:97)</em></li> </ul> <p>A "good life" means peace in the heart, even during hard times. So when the Creator is with you, everything that happens has some divine reasoning from Him. Donâ€™t you know that He is the best of planners?</p> <ul> <li><strong>"Whoever relies on Allah â€” He will be enough for them."</strong> <em>(At-Talaq 65:3)</em></li> </ul> <p>When we truly trust Allah, we stop worrying so much. And things become easier for us.</p> <ul> <li><strong>"Allah is the Protector of those who believe. He brings them out of darkness into light."</strong> <em>(Al-Baqarah 2:257)</em></li> </ul> <p>Faith is like turning on a light in a dark room. Fill yourself with Iman and you will find that your presence makes others feel more comforted.</p> <h3>Practical Solutions from the Quran for Various Causes of Depression:</h3> <h4>For Those Questioning Life's Purpose</h4> <p>Allah tells us clearly:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>"Did you think We created you without purpose, and that you would not return to Us?"</strong> <em>(Al-Mu'minun 23:115)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We are here to worship Allah and be tested. This life is like a field where we plant seeds for the next life. If you are bored, spend time with yourself â€” with books, good friends, and try to learn new hobbies, whether related to Islam or something else, but keep things Halal.</p> <h4>For Those Afraid of the Future</h4> <p>A student once came to me crying about her exams. I told her: Work hard, then say:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"My Lord, I seek refuge in You from anxieties and sorrows."</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Allah promises:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>"Whoever fears Allah, He will make a way out for them and provide from sources they could never imagine."</strong> <em>(At-Talaq 65:2-3)</em></p> </blockquote> <h4>For Those Facing Hardship</h4> <p>When you see others doing better than you, remember:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"It may be that you dislike something while it is good for you."</em> <em>(Al-Baqarah 2:216)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>That job you didn't get? Maybe Allah was protecting you from something bad.</p> <h4>For Those Afraid of Death</h4> <p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught us to remember death often â€” not to scare us, but to remind us that this life is temporary. The real life is coming!</p> <h4>For Those Who Failed</h4> <p>So your business failed? Your marriage ended? Remember:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"After difficulty comes ease."</em> <em>(Ash-Sharh 94:6)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Every great companion of the Prophet faced failures before their successes.</p>  <h3>Some May Ask: Does Sorcery Cause Depression?</h3> <p>This is a personal belief that nowadays such things are rarely happening. And every time the Quran and Sunnah mention such events, it is made clear that magic is just delusion, as Allah says about Pharaohâ€™s sorcerers:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>"...they cast a spell on the peopleâ€™s eyes and caused them to feel great fear of them. They produced an extremely powerful magic."</strong> <em>(al-Wahh 7:116)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Pay attention to this: the sorcery did not transform ropes into snakes. Rather, it made their eyes imagine that the ropes had turned into snakes, but they never did.</p> <p>Sorcery, therefore, exists but only to this extent â€” it is a phenomenon that controls a personâ€™s mind, making them imagine things that are not real. And this too does not happen without Allahâ€™s permission, S.W.T.</p> <p>For those troubled by such matters, I advise: do not go outside Allahâ€™s shelter and protection. Fortify yourselves as much as you can with the fortress of obeying Allahâ€™s commands and staying away from what He has prohibited.</p> <p>If you think you have been harmed by something like this, return to Allahâ€™s path. Seek refuge in Him, carry out His commands, and recite (wird) regularly for protection. The intention behind seeking refuge should be complete slavehood to Allah. Remember, in every situation, Allah is always with you, as He says:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>"Everyone has a succession of protectors in front of him and behind him, guarding him by Allahâ€™s command."</strong> <em>(ar-Raâ€™d 13:11)</em></p> </blockquote> <h3>How to Apply Islamic Teachings for Depression in Daily Life</h3> <ul> <li>Recognize that this universe has a Creator and Sustainer who originated and organized it.</li> <li>Do your sincere efforts and leave the rest to Allah â€” He cares for you more than what you imagine.</li> <li>Read at least 10 minutes of Quran daily â€” it is food for the soul.</li> <li>When worried, make abundant dua and dhikr.</li> <li>Help others â€” it shifts your focus away from your own problems.</li> <li>Remember: this world is like a dream, and we will meet Allah. The true life is coming!</li> </ul> <h3>Final Advice</h3> <p>Dear friend, if youâ€™re feeling down, remember that Allah sees your pain. He tells us:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>"Do not lose hope in Allah's mercy. Only disbelievers lose hope."</strong> <em>(Yusuf 12:87)</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The solution is not in pills, alcohol, or running away from problems. The real cure is turning to Allah, understanding His wisdom, and trusting His plan.</p> <p>Next time you feel sad, instead of asking "Why me?" ask "What is Allah teaching me through this?" Youâ€™ll be amazed at the peace this brings. And you will find solutions instead of lamenting over your difficulties.</p> <p>May Allah remove sadness from our hearts and replace it with faith, hope, and contentment. Ameen.</p>
